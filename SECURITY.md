## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, **please do not open a public GitHub issue**.  

Instead, report it privately by one of the following ways:  
- Opening a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-security-advisory) (if enabled), OR  
- Emailing me directly at **developerpuneet2010@gmail.com**  

I‚Äôll do my best to acknowledge reports within **48 hours** and provide updates as I investigate.  
Fixes will be prioritized and released in the next available commit or tagged version.  

Thanks for helping keep this project safe üôè
